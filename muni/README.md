# User Guide

## Python Scripts

Python scripts are used to configure `spect_iss` with all operation config word, input data and random numbers and run `spect_iss` with prepared spect firmware. The input data and random numbers are configured by YAML file `<sript name>_data_cfg.yml`. To run the script, simply run
```
./<script name>.py
```

## Configuration YAML File

To configure input data and random numbers used for masking and randomization, use the prepared `<sript name>_data_cfg.yml`. Structure of such YAML file is following:
```
input : (mandatory)
  - name : <name of input variable> (string)
    value : <value of the input variable> (string or integer)
  ...
rng : (optional)
  - name : <name of random number> (string)
    value : <value of the random number> (integer)
  ...
```

The `rng` field is used to force masks used in the particular algorithm. The `name` of the random number refer to particular mask, e.g. mask for group randomization of scalar. The python script than ensures that the masks are pushed into the GRV queue of `spect_iss` in the right order. If the `rng` field is not specified or some particular mask is not specified, the script generates random number instate.

## Log Files

Log files are dumped into `<run dir>/logs` directory.

- `iss_cmd` : cmd file for iss generated by the python script
- `rng.hex` : hexfile generated by the python script, that contains the random numbers to be pushed into the GRV queue of `spect_iss`
- `<script name>_iss.log` : log file of the `spect_iss` run, that contains all of its actions (compilation, instruction execution details etc.)
- `<script name>_out.hex` : hexfile with contents of the output memory.

## Other

Some masks used for side channel hardening must not be zero (e.g. z-coordinate randomization). Firmware detects such case and requests another random number. In such a case, the python scrypt checks, if for the particular mask zero value is allowed, and if not, generates alternative mask and puts it to the GRV queue behind the zero one.
