## Setup <a name="command_setup"></a>

### Firmware Compilation and Preload

To compile the MPW1 firmware, run

```
make compile_mpw1
```

This compiles the MPW1 firmware to [`build_mpw1/main_mpw1.hex`](../build_mpw1/main_mpw1.hex) directory. User then writes this hex file to SPECTs Instruction RAM (from address `0x8000` in SPECTs address space).

Ensure you have the `spect_compiler` binaries in the environment path.

---
### Constants

Constants for MPW1 FW are specified in [`data/data_ram_in_const_config.yml`](../data/data_ram_in_const_config.yml).

To generate hex file from this config file, run

```
make data_ram_in_const
```

It generates the hex file to [`data/constants_data_in.hex`](../data/constants_data_in.hex) and also address descriptors that are then used in FW source code. This target is called automatically when running `compile_mpw1` target.

After every reset/power-up, user must write the content of the hex file starting from address `0x0200` in SPECTs address space (the address can be changed in the mentioned config file).

---
### Command ID

**CMD_ID** is identifier of every command. SPECT FW runs desired command based on this value. The value of **CMD_ID** for every command is stated in [Commands](#commands) description.

To select particular command to be executed by the FW, user must write the **CMD_ID** on address `0x0000` in SPECTs address space before launching SPECT with **COMMAND[START]** register.

---
## Commands <a name="commands"></a>

This section provides an overview of commands supported by MPW1 SPECT firmware. All commands perform some elliptic curve operation or whole DSA scheme. All commands use the same algorithm to compute scalar point multiple on a elliptic curve: [Montgomery ladder](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/293) (conditional swap version). For more information about the ECC algorithms used, refer to headers of source files in [`src/ecc_math`](../src/ecc_math/).

If user specifies different **CMD_ID** then the ones stated below, SPECT FW ends with **RET_CODE** `0xF0`.

## Side Channel Countermeasures <a name="scc"></a>

This section provides an overview on how MPW1 SPECT firmware implements some side chanel countermeasures on elliptic curves. All ECC algorithms are performed in constant time (number of clock cycles). The only case when the command is not performed in constant time is when it fails.

### Scalar Multiplication <a name="scc_scm"></a>

MPW1 SPECT firmware implements 2 side chanel countermeasures on ECC scalar point multiplication:

#### 1. Projective coordinates randomization:

SPECT FW uses projective coordinates:

$$(x, y) = (X, Y, Z)$$

where

$$x = X/Z, y = Y/Z$$

to perform ECC point addition/doubling. The projective coordinates are ambiguous: $(X, Y, Z) = (\lambda X, \lambda Y, \lambda Z)$. Therefore for each computation, the absolute values can differ. SPECT FW, before every computation, transform affine coordinates to projective as follows:

$$(x, y) \rightarrow (t1 x, t1 y, t1)$$

#### 2. Scalar randomization:

SPECT includes and special instruction to randomize the scalar. This instruction transforms the 256 bit scalar **k** to its 512 bit equivalent using following function:

$$Blind(k, t2, q) := q \times (t2 | (2^{255} + 2^{223})) + k$$

---

### ECDSA Signature <a name="scc_ecdsa_sign"></a>

When computing ECDSA s-part, multiplicative inversion of the nonce **k** is computed. SPECT FW masks this operation by multiplying the nonce with a random number first. The resulting equation for s-part is following:

$$s = (z\cdot t3 + r \cdot t3 \cdot d) \cdot (k \cdot t3)^{-1}$$

In addition, the $r \cdot t3 \cdot d$ is computed in such order, so we avoid computing $r \cdot d$.
